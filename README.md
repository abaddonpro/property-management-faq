            <div class="faq-category">
                <p class="faq-question">Q: What is the process for renting out my property?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A: Renting out your property involves several key steps:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property Assessment:</strong> We evaluate the property, suggesting necessary improvements or repairs to maximize rent potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Analysis:</strong> We analyze local rental data to recommend an optimal rental price based on comparable properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising and Marketing:</strong> We list the property on popular rental platforms, including Zillow, Apartments.com, and local MLS services, to attract quality tenants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Showings:</strong> We coordinate showings of the property to interested tenants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tenant Screening:</strong> Our thorough screening process includes checking credit, criminal history, income, and rental references.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lease Signing:</strong> Once we’ve selected the tenant, we prepare and execute a legally sound lease agreement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Move-In Coordination:</strong> We handle the move-in process, ensuring that everything is in order before the tenant takes possession.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-category">
                <p class="faq-question">Q: How do you ensure that tenants are qualified?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A: We use a robust tenant screening process, which includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Credit History:</strong> We look for a solid credit history with no recent bankruptcies or significant delinquencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Checks:</strong> Criminal background checks are performed to ensure there are no violent or property-damaging offenses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Income Verification:</strong> We require documentation showing the tenant’s monthly income is at least 3 times the rent amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rental History:</strong> We speak with previous landlords to verify the tenant’s behavior, payment history, and property care.</li>
                    <li><strong>References:</strong> We ask for personal references to confirm the tenant’s reliability.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="faq-category">
                <p class="faq-question">Q: What happens if a tenant breaks their lease early?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A: If a tenant breaks the lease early, we follow the terms outlined in the lease agreement. Typically, the tenant will be responsible for paying rent until a new tenant is found or for a specified early termination fee. We assist in finding a replacement tenant as quickly as possible to minimize the vacancy period and mitigate any financial loss to the property owner.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">A: As the property owner, you’re responsible for major repairs and maintaining the property’s structure and systems. However, tenants are generally responsible for day-to-day upkeep (e.g., cleaning, changing lightbulbs). Our team ensures that repairs are promptly addressed and that the property is well-maintained.</p>

            <div class="faq-category">
                <p class="faq-question">Q: How are rental payments collected?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A: We collect rent through an online portal, making it easy for tenants to pay using credit/debit cards, ACH transfers, or other payment methods.

                <p class="faq-answer">A: If rent is not paid on time, we send a formal reminder to the tenant. If the rent remains unpaid, we issue a late fee as outlined in the lease agreement. After 10 days, we send a formal notice requesting payment. If payments are still not received, we start the eviction process, which is carried out in compliance with California laws.</p>
